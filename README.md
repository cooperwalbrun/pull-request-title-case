`GitHub Pull Request Title Case Helper` is a browser extension for transforming GitHub pull request
titles into their MLA-compliant title-cased equivalents. It aims to deliver this functionality
across multiple web browsers (currently, Chrome and Firefox).

The core mechanism introduced by this extension is a new `tc` button in the GitHub website's pull
request interface which, when clicked, will transform the pull request's title in-place. Below are
some examples.

## Project Notes

Several of the things this repository does are influenced/informed by design decisions made in
[vitesse-webext](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse-webext) and
[vite-plugin-web-extension](https://github.com/aklinker1/vite-plugin-web-extension/tree/main). While
this project does not directly utilize either of these, they deserve recognition and support for
their valuable efforts!

### Project Structure

The overall structure of this project's source files follows the ensuing convention:

* `src/assets`
   * Static assets - namely, images, non-compiled CSS/JS/HTML, etc
* `src/content-script`
   * Source code that is specific to the `tc` button's display and functionality
* `src/popup`
   * Source code that is specific to the popup's display and functionality (note: "popup" here
     refers to the button that appears next to the URL bar in the browser that users can click to
     display a miniature UI for the extension)
* `src/content-script.ts`
   * The main "entrypoint" for Vite to compile all the source code for the `tc` button
* `src/popup.html`
   * The main "entrypoint" for Vite to compile all the source code for the popup
* `tests`
   * All unit tests for the project divided in a way that corresponds to the `tc`/popup segregation
     described above
* `vite.config.ts`
   * Source code for the build configuration of the extension, including a dynamic implementation of
     the `manifest.json` in TypeScript

### Title-Casing Conventions

The title-casing logic in this extension is influenced by the conventions of
[Capitalize My Title](https://capitalizemytitle.com/style/MLA). In many cases, we reference this
website's output to disambiguate how certain rules should behave in edge cases, though we also try
to conduct further supplementary research in order to find legitimate documentation describing the
rules.

### Extension Icon

The icon for this project was generated by running the
[Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator), then copying and manipulating the output
files to create the variants with alternative dimensions.

The parameters used were:

* Text: `tc`
* Background: `Circle`
* Font Family: `Roboto`
* Font Variant: `Bold 700 Normal`
* Font Size: `90`
* Font Color: `#fff`
* Background Color: `#a5f`
