## Overview

`GitHub Pull Request Title-Case Helper` is a browser extension for transforming GitHub pull request titles into
their MLA-compliant title-cased equivalents. It aims to deliver this functionality across multiple
web browsers (currently, Chrome and Firefox).

The core mechanism introduced by this extension is a new `tc` button in the GitHub website's pull
request interface which, when clicked, will transform the pull request's title in-place. Below are
some examples.

## Project Notes

Several of the things this repository does are influenced/informed by design decisions made in
[vitesse-webext](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse-webext) and
[vite-plugin-web-extension](https://github.com/aklinker1/vite-plugin-web-extension/tree/main). While
this project does not directly utilize either of these, they deserve recognition and support for
their valuable efforts!

### Extension Icon

The icon for this project was generated by running the
[Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator), then copying and manipulating the output
files to create the variants with alternative dimensions.

The parameters used were:

* Text: `tc`
* Background: `Circle`
* Font Family: `Roboto`
* Font Variant: `Bold 700 Normal`
* Font Size: `90`
* Font Color: `#fff`
* Background Color: `#a5f`
